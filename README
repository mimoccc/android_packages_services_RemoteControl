RemoteControl Input Service
===========================

This service is started at boot time and checks for a connected USB IR
Transceiver. If one is found then we can use this service to set the keymaps
and protocols to allow AndroidTV to be controlled by a STB IR RemoteControl
such as the various ones shipped by Sky UK.


A Useful command line for a quick turn around!
==============================================

adb remount && mm && \
adb push $ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT/system/priv-app/RemoteControl/RemoteControl.apk \
/system/priv-app/RemoteControl/RemoteControl.apk && adb reboot
